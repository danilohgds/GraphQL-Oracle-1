# GraphQL-Oracle-1
An example of node-oracledb usage with provisioning done by GraphQL endpoint.

### Goals
- Show folks an implementation example of node-oracledb being backed up by an GraphQL endpoint.

###Remarks

> This code will contain tests in the future. Also note that the current goal of this repo is only to show an example implementation, as performance will not be evaluated by me at first.
